# Cplusplus_KnightsTour_Stack
In teams of two, develop a program that will solve the Knight's Tour for any starting position given by the end-user 
on a standard chessboard. Your program with then print, in standard chessboard nomenclature, the moves that the knight 
must take to touch each square once and only once. After displaying the moves, your program should state whether the 
solution it provided is either open or closed. Additionally, since you have already done recursive programs in the 
pre-requisite courses, you must implement backtracking in two different methods. First, by using a stack that you've 
developed, and then secondly, with a queue that you've developed. Run times for each of these methods must be calculated 
and displayed. Your program must also offer the end-user the ability to print the tour as well as re-run the tour with a 
different starting point.

On the due date, you and your partner must demonstrate your program during lab. Printouts of your code must be submitted 
at the time of demonstration. As in the printer in R211 is not functioning, you must bring printouts prior to class!
